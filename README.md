# As a good Javascript Developer, a good knowledge of the Dom is very important

# The goal of this simple project is to have fun with the following simple concepts by manipulating the DOM:

1. Adding items to list via form
2. Remove items from the list by clicking the remobe button
3. Add a clear button that clears all available items onClick
4. Update the items
5. Persist items by adding them to the localStorage
